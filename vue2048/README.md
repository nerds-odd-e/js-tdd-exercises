The 2048 game in Vue.js


This is based on 2048 by [Gabriele Cirulli],
and it uses some code from [his repos] about the keybinding, touch events, and the css styling.


The main functionality is written using Vue.js,
a very flexible MVVM library.


This is inspired from the following [ng-newsletter article]


You can play the [game here].
